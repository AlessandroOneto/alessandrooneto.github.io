                    I am a mathematician working in <b>Algebraic Geometry</b> and <b>Commutative Algebra</b>, with a focus on the study of tensors from both a theoretical and applied perspective. I am passionate about teaching and I always try to find new ways to engage students during my lectures. I am also committed about mentoring young researchers and helping them to develop their skills and reach their full potential. I am also involved in several outreach activities aimed at promoting mathematics to a wider audience.

                    <p>I agree with <a href="https://fardila.com/">Federico Ardila's axioms on diversity</a>. <br> 
                        I try to implement them in my daily life as a mathematician, teacher, and mentor:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.</li>
                        <li>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.</li>
                        <li>Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.</li>
                        <li>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.</li>

                        Launched in February 2024, <strong><a href="https://multilinearverse.github.io/" target="_blank">MultilinearVerse</a></strong> is a dynamical portal designed to unify the rapidly growing literature on tensors. It serves as a guide through more than one century of algebra, geometry and applied mathematics, providing the community with a resource to rapidly look up facts and track different relevant references.

                    <p>
                        This is an ambitious resource at an early stage, currently maintained by myself together with <strong>Fulvio Gesmundo</strong> (U. Toulouse) and <strong>Alessandro Iannone</strong> (JAKALA). We welcome contributions from the community to help populate and expand the database.
